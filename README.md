# PepWM
PepTWC is written in Rust its a wayland compositor
it is designed to be fast and lightweight while also modular and customisable

ðŸš§ðŸš§ *its currently ***VERY*** experimental and i dont recommend using it as a main WM untill a beta version comes*

# Installing
*from source*
1. install Rust and xorg-server and Wayland
2. run `cargo build`
3. run `cargo run`
4. run `./pepwm`

# Plans and features
currently, PepWM only launches a terminal on start, future versions will have xkbcommon for inputs
